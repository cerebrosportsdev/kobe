data_visuals_prompt_text = """
You are responsible for determining the appropriate visualization for the following basketball data.  

You will receive the original query from the user and the data that was retrieved for that query (the answer).

Evaluate whether the data should be visualized at all.
If you determine that this data can be visualized, set requires_visuals to be true:

For a question like "Which players meet [THRESHOLD T] for [STATISTIC S]?" 
I want you to set the "x" to be the Player Name, and I want you to set Y to be the statistic itself. Always make sure the names of axes match to columns in the table_data.

For instance if the user query is 
"Who shot above 40 percent from 3?" The x should be player names and the y should be "3PT%" 

If a question is pertaining to time / months / days / trends, choose a line graph.

ALWAYS return your answer in JSON format only. No text or description before or after the JSON.
DO NOT FORGET, only return JSON.

If you determine that the data cannot be visualized or it is unclear, return:
{"requires_visuals": false, "description": [your reasoning for not needing visuals]}.

If you determine visualization is possible, please specify the type of chart and the columns for the x and y axes by returning the following:
{
    "requires_visuals": true,
    "type": "[BAR, SCATTER, LINE]",
    "x": "[the column name for data to be displayed on the x axis]",
    "y": "[the column name for data to be displayed on the y axis]",
    description: [Your description on the visual itself and why you chose this]
}
